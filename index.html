                        <h4>
                        Ada, I hope you're still obsessed with that name. I've been thinking of what to say in this letter for the whole week. I deeply want to apologize but that's not what today is about.<br>
                        Today is about you turning 19. Or 25?<br>
                        It's been 74 days since we started talking and I won't lie I got addicted to talking, listening to you.
                        You're really interesting in a cute way. It's how you added words that I could never be caught saying to my vocabulary. It's how you always derive one thing to call me and be shouting "stop now" when I try to do the same. It's how you put up with the whole yeye stuff that's doing me.
                        You've done way too much for me in these 74 days Nonye, you've been a nutritionist "Don't eat, give the noodles to the dog, drink water"
                        You've been a spiritual guide, you've been a Doctor, you've taught me to feel again, you've made me realize that I'm not as reasonable as I think I am.<br>
                        And after all these, I've just done the exact opposite.
                        So consider today an attempt to make you smile at least.<br>
                        
                        You're outstandingly amazing Nonye, you're definitely a highlight in my life. I'm really really happy that I met you.
                        I wish you that happiness and loads more.<br>
                        I pray God grants you the strength to attain all you want and navigate adulthood.<br>
                        I pray that you'll excel in everything you do.<br>
                        And I hope you realize how beautiful, brilliant and astonishing you are.<br>
                        Please don't let my folly make you feel less.<br>
                        You are loved and appreciated more than words can say.<br>
